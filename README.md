New features in the current [CNCL](https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9P42TB5T697H) release requires some GRBL compiler options changes. These compiler options changes are implemented in this GRBL fork to make it easy to compile and flash the modified GRBL to an Arduino for running on a lathe.  
The compiler options are described in the [GRBL-L Wiki](https://github.com/HuubBuis/grbl-L/wiki). For all other information read the [GRBL Wiki](https://github.com/gnea/grbl/wiki)  
I am working on a lathe threading solution for the arduino uno. Read [Wiki Threading](https://github.com/HuubBuis/grbl-L/wiki/Threading) for more information.
