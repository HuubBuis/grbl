30882 VStudio report sizes program storage space
30878 // config.h //#define MESSAGE_PROBE_COORDINATES

All code changed implemented, tested ok on the bench using simulated spindle index and synchronization pulse.
Dynamic memory is less than the original GRBL version.
Disabled all laser defines in config.h to reduce code to avoid memory errors when in future, Arduino IDE updates its boards or compiler
